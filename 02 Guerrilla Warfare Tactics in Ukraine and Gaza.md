Guerrilla Warfare Tactics in Ukraine and Gaza

Introduction

Guerrilla warfare, characterized by small, mobile groups using hit-and-run tactics, has been a significant aspect of conflicts in both Ukraine and Gaza. This report explores the various guerrilla tactics employed in these regions, drawing from recent and relevant sources.

Guerrilla Warfare Tactics in Gaza

Tunnel Networks and Surprise Attacks

Hamas has shifted its tactics towards guerrilla warfare, utilizing a vast network of tunnels to launch surprise attacks. These tunnels, exceeding 500 km in length, allow small squads to operate covertly, launching attacks with anti-tank missiles, RPGs, explosives, IEDs, and snipers 
. The extensive tunnel system poses significant challenges for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), requiring substantial quantities of explosives to destroy 
.


Rocket Attacks and Diversions

Hamas employs unconventional warfare strategies, including launching thousands of rockets to overwhelm Israel's Iron Dome defense system. This tactic serves as a diversion, allowing fighters to flank IDF soldiers and target weaker rear armor 
. Additionally, explosives and bulldozers are used to breach barriers, facilitating the entry of fighters into Israeli territory 
.


Targeting Leadership and Infrastructure

The IDF's strategy includes targeted commando raids based on precise intelligence to locate and eliminate Hamas's military leadership. The primary focus is on figures like Yahya Sinwar, Muhammad Deif, and Marwan Issa 
. Israel aims to prevent Hamas from maintaining any governmental outpost in Gaza 
.

Guerrilla Warfare Tactics in Ukraine

Civilian Involvement and Sabotage

In Ukraine, civilians play a crucial role in guerrilla warfare. Hunters and villagers have captured tanks, destroyed convoys, and taken Russian soldiers prisoner 
. Civilians also confiscate weapons and supplies from the enemy, supporting Ukrainian forces 
.

Peaceful Resistance and Territorial Defense

Peaceful resistance, including demonstrations and marches, occurs daily in Russian-controlled cities like Kherson, Melitopol, and Enerhodar 
. The Territorial Defense Forces are being raised to bolster Ukrainian fighting power, with Special Operations Forces leading the organization and support of the resistance movement 
.

Increased Weapon Distribution

The number of weapons in Ukraine has risen significantly, with nearly 20,000 guns distributed to reservists in Kyiv immediately after the invasion. This preparation aims to defend the capital and other strategic locations 
.

Urban Guerrilla Tactics

Ukrainian guerrillas infiltrate Russian-occupied towns and villages, targeting soldiers, occupation police, and local collaborators. This urban warfare strategy creates multiple dilemmas for the occupying forces, leveraging the asymmetry between the stronger and weaker sides 
.


Conclusion

Guerrilla warfare in Gaza and Ukraine involves a combination of covert operations, civilian involvement, and strategic use of urban environments. In Gaza, Hamas relies heavily on tunnel networks and rocket attacks, while in Ukraine, civilian resistance and urban guerrilla tactics play a significant role. Both regions demonstrate the effectiveness of asymmetrical warfare in challenging conventional military forces.

By understanding these tactics, military strategists can better prepare for and counteract guerrilla warfare in future conflicts.

# War Techniques Used in the Russo-Ukraine War

The Russo-Ukraine war, which began in February 2022, has seen a variety of military techniques and strategies employed by both sides. This report synthesizes key points from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the war techniques used in this conflict.

## Conventional and Hybrid Warfare

### Conventional Warfare
Conventional warfare refers to traditional military operations involving large-scale battles between organized armed forces. In the Russo-Ukraine war, both sides have engaged in significant conventional military operations.

- **Ukrainian Autumn Counter-Offensive**: This operation is considered a masterpiece of conventional offensive strategy, showcasing Ukraine's ability to conduct large-scale, coordinated military actions against Russian forces.
- **Russian 'Dark Skies' Air Operations**: These operations aim to neutralize or destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, supporting conventional military efforts by disrupting the opponent's logistical and operational capabilities.

### Hybrid Warfare
Hybrid warfare combines conventional military tactics with unconventional methods, including cyber attacks, information warfare, and the use of irregular forces.

- **Hybrid Actions**: Since the beginning of the invasion, Russia has supported its conventional operations with hybrid actions, including cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns, amplified by the nuclear threat. Hybrid warfare was first described by Frank Hoffman and involves the simultaneous use of conventional and non-conventional means.

## Tactical Nuclear Weapons

Russia has conducted tactical nuclear weapons drills near the Ukraine border, involving Iskander and Kinzhal missiles. These exercises are designed to ensure the readiness of units and equipment for the potential use of non-strategic nuclear weapons on the battlefield. Tactical nuclear weapons have vast destructive potential and are intended for use in specific combat scenarios to achieve strategic objectives.

## Strategic Deterrence

Strategic deterrence involves using both military and non-military means to prevent an opponent from achieving strategic gains. Russia's approach includes an aggressive military build-up, diplomacy, information warfare, and political tactics to shape the strategic environment without resorting to full-scale force. This form of active containment aims to achieve strategic goals while minimizing direct military confrontation.

## Advanced Military Technologies

### Precision-Strike Systems
Advancements in weapons and sensor technologies have significantly impacted the character of warfare in Ukraine. The ability to detect and strike targets with precision has increased the vulnerability of dense troop concentrations, limiting the feasibility of large-scale operations.

- **Reconnaissance-Strike Complex**: Developed by the Soviets, this system enables preemptive attacks on enemy deep-strike capabilities, emphasizing the importance of independently operating formations and rapid movement from dispersed positions.

### Drones and Unmanned Systems
Drones have become integral to both sides of the conflict, used for reconnaissance, targeting, and direct attacks.

- **Bayraktar TB2 Drone**: This relatively cheap drone, made with off-the-shelf parts, has been effective in delivering lethal strikes and recording its kills on video.
- **Loitering Munitions and Electronic Warfare**: Russian forces have increasingly relied on loitering munitions for counterbattery fire and electronic warfare to counter Ukrainian UAVs.

## Key Weapons Systems

Several key weapons systems have played crucial roles in the conflict:

- **Javelin Anti-Tank Missiles**: These shoulder-fired, guided missiles have been effective in destroying Russian tanks.
- **HIMARS**: A mobile rocket launcher system capable of launching multiple rockets simultaneously, providing significant firepower.
- **M777 Howitzer**: Used by Ukrainian forces to target Russian positions, this artillery piece has been a critical component of Ukraine's defensive and offensive operations.

## Conclusion

The Russo-Ukraine war has seen a blend of conventional and hybrid warfare, the use of advanced military technologies, and strategic deterrence tactics. Both sides have employed a range of techniques and weapons systems to gain the upper hand, making this conflict one of the most complex and multifaceted wars in recent history. The ongoing evolution of military strategies and technologies will continue to shape the course of this war.
